      description: |
        JWT-based authentication using Bearer token scheme.
        
        **Authentication Flow:**
        1. **Login**: Obtain JWT token by calling `POST /auth/login` with valid credentials
        2. **API Access**: Include the token in Authorization header for all subsequent requests
          ```
          Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token_here>
          ```
        
        **Security Notes:**
        - Tokens contain necessary user identification and authorization claims
        - Tokens have expiration time (configured server-side)
        - Protect tokens from exposure - treat them as sensitive credentials
        - Refresh token mechanism may be available via separate endpoint
